	"why_answer": "Widespread improvements in the quality of life of many of the world’s populations have gone hand-in-hand with increased demands on natural resources. The planet is struggling to keep up. Increases in the average global temperature, and the frequency of extreme weather events are transforming ecosystems around the world and threatening entire species of plants and animals. Forests are drying up because there is less rainfall and thus more fires, and the glaciers of both the North and South Poles are shrinking. The consequences of climate change affect all of us, but to react and adapt to these challenges, we must first understand them.",
	"briefing_title": "Ukraine conflict environmental briefing: the climate crisis",
	"briefing_description": "The armed conflict in Ukraine has seen unprecedented attention on its impact on the global climate. This has included its influence on global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, both domestically and through reverberating international pathways, and on Ukraine’s ongoing efforts to decarbonise its economy and adapt to a changing climate. In bringing long-overdue attention to the carbon cost of warfare, the conflict has highlighted the absence of methods for tracking wartime emissions, the extent of global fossil fuel insecurity, and generated expectations over how Ukraine’s post-war recovery should accelerate its climate action.",
	"marine_title": "Marine and coastal environmental threats",
	"marine_description": "Military operations cause chemical pollution of freshwater resources directly – from dumping of ammunition and war equipment, decomposition of ammunition, and release and leaching of explosive residues – and indirectly from damage to industrial facilities. Groundwater, which meets 25% of Ukraine’s drinking water needs, can be contaminated by leaching of explosive residues, such as perchlorate and nitrate, from soil. During war, damage to water infrastructure occurs directly and indirectly as a result of military attacks, despite international conventions that ban attacks on water infrastructure (such as dams) when the civilian damage is out of proportion to military advantage. These attacks deprive people of drinking water, disrupt sanitation, and pollute surface water and groundwater.",
	"indeed": "For more than a decade, People in Need has been helping at-risk communities around the world to cope with the effects of climate change and to adapt to a changing planet. Our goal is to make our planet a better place to live, not only for ourselves, but for the nearly 10 billion people who will share it in 2050. You can help us achieve this goal.",
